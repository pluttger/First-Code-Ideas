# First-Code-Ideas

As inspiration will follow only the flow of creativity this is where this project wil start.
For now its only text, some blank spaces and a place to just put down my roots in the programming world once again.
Gone for about ten years but never far away from a device to tinker with.
Seeing that the world has changed a bit in this virtual space I'm also changing my views on programming.
With this in mind there's room for integration software on the web but also a nead for code that is portable across platforms.
So in the near future this space will be changing.

See the future for what it is and look at where your bum is now!.
